### Numerical resolution of Van Roosbrock equation in a Weyl semimetal

# Objective

 This project is about computing the current, electrostatic potential and local chemical potential profile of different devices. One might consider the pesence of a voltage difference or a incident light beam. We consider the case of a 1D semiconductor and a 3D Weyl semimetal udner strong magnetic field
